# Changeling the Dreaming 5e

Based on the fan-made Changeling the Dreaming 5th Edition book by Charlie Cantrell and Yogarpg.

# Introduction

This system allows storytellers and players to play the fanmade Changeling the Dreaming 5e by leveraging and extending the base World of Darkness 5e system, with permission granted by Charlie Cantrell.

## Dice

To roll the Changeling and Nightmare dice, replace the usual roll formula like so:
* Changeling dice are 1dc
* Nightmare dice are 1dn

Replace the 1s with however many you want to roll for each type, and let the dice roll! We will eventually also have compatibility with the [Dice So Nice!](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/dice-so-nice/) module, so when that's implemented, whenever you roll splat dice you'll get the Changeling symbols on the 3D dice faces.
